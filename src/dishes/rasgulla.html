          Why does this recipe work
        </h1>

        Well, the name  Rasgulla is itself sufficient for its popularity. Yet
        there are certain key things that make this recipe a perfect dessert. To
        name a few
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold"> Shape and Texture -</span>
            There is no denying that, the Rasgullas are super attractive. If not
            convinced, just look at the photos in this post. In addition, the
            moist and soft texture due to the sugar syrup is just icing on the
            cake.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold"> Cooking Steps -</span> Generally, the
            assumption is that, any premium Indian dessert recipes are
            comparatively complicated to prepare. Yet there are few recipes as
            exceptions. One such premium dessert recipe is  Rasgulla Recipe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold"> Basic Ingredients - </span>Typically
            all premium Indian sweets are made out of a complex combination of
            ingredients or niche ingredients. However, in this recipe, the soft
            Rasgullas are made out of milk solids or milk powder.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold"> Versatile </span> The biggest advantage
            of this recipe is the variations by which it can be served. It can
            be served chilled, warm, hot, or with other toppings. The popular
            toppings are vanilla ice cream or any type of creamy ice cream.

          Chef Tips for Soft  Rasgulla:
        </h1>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Ingredients Quality -</span> The quality
            of the milk powder or khoya is super important for this recipe.
            Fresh ingredients should help to get better texture and softness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Dough Kneading -</span> Kneading can
            define the result of this recipe. The kneading should be done with
            the palm and not with fingers for gentle pressure. Knead it till it
            becomes lite sticky.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Frying Temperature -</span> Ghee or oil
            used for frying, should not be piping hot. It should be moderate in
            temperature so that it gets slowly and evenly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Shape &amp; Size -</span> Size matters.
            Small-sized balls are easy to shape without any cracks while frying.
            Particularly, if you are a beginner, start with a small size and
            increase it gradually.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Sugar Syrup -</span> The sugar syrup
            should not have even single thread consistency. It should be lite so
            that it can be easily absorbed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Overcrowding -</span> Do not overcrowd
            while deep frying or soaking in sugar syrup. Give little space to
            these Rasgullas as they tend to increase in its size in each step.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Practice -</span> It is a simple and
            easy recipe, yet room for mistakes. I trust, each time you prepare,
            you would learn and rationalize from previous encounters.
