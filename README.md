I have used Figma to create a wireframe for my website. It is a free, online UI tool that allows us to create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. It really helped me visualize my website and plan out the design. First I created an overall layout for my website, then I created a wireframe for each page. They are very similar to the each other.
